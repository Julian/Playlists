Playlists

This is a plaintext version of some music playlists.

It's got things like a set of remember-the-year playlists in particular,
which aren't really complete (I add to them when I remember a song
that's from a given year that I like). But they're my way of remembering
what I was listening to or liked from a given year. It's also a bit
anachronistic, some songs I didn't really find in the year they were
released, but I blur those lines a bit.

I have some vague ideas to turn this into an "executable" plain text playlist
format. But for now, it's literally just static files. Some day...
